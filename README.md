# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-Using-Bayesian-Regression
Reference paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.1231.pdf  

In this project, the task was to predict the price variations of bitcoin. These predictions could be used as the foundation of a bitcoin trading strategy. To make these predictions, I used a machine learning technique, Bayesian Regression, and implemented this technique in Python. 
The Python packages used were numpy, pandas, sklearn, and statsmodels.
